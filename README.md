Partition/Fragment assignment strategy or algorithm.

A round-robin strategy is enough for a newly created table to balance the distribution.

For shrink, the best result of balance means the `upper bound - lower bound <= 1`.

Example:

```plain
    let replication_factor = 3;
    let partitions = 60;
    let nodes: Vec<_> = (1..=5).map(|n| Node(n)).collect();
